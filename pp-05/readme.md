## ITMD 362 Production Problem 5: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette (you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make). Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the color you did.

Opt for the Paletton Preview mode Default with Text; you can start at this URL if you like: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF

1. An adjacent color palette for introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53+0u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: Although people use bright colors to introduce a new product, but I wanted to give it a subtle look in order to make it look professional, but elite.

2. A triadic color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=32-0u1kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: I went for these colors mainly because they remind me of spring. Light colors, but they still pop.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for a private messaging app

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33W0u1kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aFkllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF
Your Rationale: This one was a bit difficult primary because the colors popped a bit too much. However, I went for the darker colors to show privacy and the lighter colors brighten up the mood a bit.

4. A monochromatic color palette for advertising a course on Ruby on Rails

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=15-050kCViwsMrHvomvM8dRUg8j
Your Rationale: This was easy, because Rubies are red and I wanted to portray that in the palette. I also didn't want to choose one that was too bright because it puts a strain on the users eyes.

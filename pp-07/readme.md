# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742480(v=vs.85).aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: For design, we wanted to make it as simplistic as possible. The main login page has an IIT backround that's
  blurred out. There's also an IIT logo on top. For the main lgin section, there's a black background with opacity set below 100%. The footer 
  is very simple as well. 

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742463.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: For interaction, I decided to use percision. I wanted the fields to be easily accessible so that the 
  user wouldn't get annoyed.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dn742399.aspx
* How you implemented it in your sketch: For controls, we want to only have 2 buttons in order to make it ass simplistic as possible.
  The two buttons are pretty straight-forward. If you click the DROP COURSE button, your current schedule comes up and there are 
  check boxes next to your courses. Clicking on them allows you to select the classes you want to drop.

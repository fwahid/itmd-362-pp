# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: High quality design. ASUS is known for using an aluminum uni-body (like Apple) designs with a swirl pattern. 
  One would expect high quality from the company.

* Behavioral: Very user-friendly. Large trackpad along with a high-resoution screen. Very snappy even though it's a 7 y/o computer.

* Reflective: It's not my phone so I don't have the urgency to keep looking at it, but I do like to clean it up a lot just to see the 
aluminum shine even if I don't use it.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Behavioral qualities: Has to be user friendly - large buttons and less clicks.
2. Visceral qualities: Students expect to add/drop courses seemlessly; without going through several links. 
3. Reflective qualities: Sometimes when I log out, I forget how I went to a certain link; We need to remove all those unnecessary links.
